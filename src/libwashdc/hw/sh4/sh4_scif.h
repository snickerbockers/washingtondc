/*
 * SH4 SCIF (Serial Port) emulation
 *
 * This hooks up the Dreamcast's serial port to TCP/IP so you can interact
 * with it using programs like telnet.
 *
 * The timing here isn't very accurate, due to equal parts necessity and
 * lazyness.  The best-case-scenario bandwidth is 115.2 kbaud (and the
 * practical-scenario is significantly lower than that) and since the virtual
 * dreamcast could be running significantly slower than a real dreamcast, it
 * doesn't make sense to implement this in the same way as a real SH4 SCIF.
 * There has to be additional buffering well in excess of the measly 16-bytes
 * that you'd get on real hardware.
 *
 * One way to implement this accurately (this is where the lazy part comes in)
 * would be to simulate an actual terminal server connected to the SCIF. 
 * The virtual terminal server would buffer data taken over TCP (since
 * ostensibly real terminal servers have to solve the problem of asymmetric
 * bandwidth too) and send that data over a simulated serial link to the SCIF
 * at a steady 9.6 kbps (or whatever bandwidth the user has configured), with
 * the flow-control, stop bits, parity, etc all taken into account.
 *
 * AFAIK the only official releases that use the serial port are a handful of
 * Japan-only SNK releases that hook up with the Neo Geo Pocket Color, which
 * isn't something I'm going to be in a position to support any time soon.  The
 * homebrew stuff primarily uses it for logging and console access, for which
 * purposes HLE will suffice.  I might need to rewrite this all later if I want
 * to support those SD card adapters that can plug into the serial port, but as
 * with the Neo Geo Pocket stuff, that's a long way into the future.
