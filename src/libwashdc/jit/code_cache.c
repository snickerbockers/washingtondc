 *
 * The reason it is here is that my laptop doesn't have much memory, and when
 * the cache gets too big then my latop will thrash and become unresponsive.
 *
 * Under normal operation, I don't think the cache should get this big.  This
 * typically only happens when there's a bug in the cache that causes it to
 * keep making more and more cache entries because it is unable to find the
 * ones it has already created.  Dreamcast only has 16MB of memory, so it's
 * very unlikely (albeit not impossible) that this cache would hit 16-million
 * different jump-in points without getting reset via a write to the SH4's CCR
