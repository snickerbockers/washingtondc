/*
 * x86_64 System V ABI (for Unix systems).
 * Source:
 *     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI
 *
 * non-float args go into RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9
 * Subsequent args get pushed on to the stack, just like in x86 stdcall.
 * If calling a variadic function, number of floats in SSE/AvX regs needs to be
 * passed in RAX
 * non-float return values go into RAX
 * If returning a 128-bit value, RDX is used too (I am not sure which register
 * is high and which register is low).
 * values in RBX, RBP, R12-R15 will be saved by the callee (and also I think
 * RSP, but the wiki page doesn't say that).
 * All other values should be considered clobberred by the function call.
