 * The purpose of this file is to store settings for the graphics renderer.
 * There's a "default" configuration that renders everything the way you'd
 * expect (ie like a real Dreamcast would), but users can make changes to those
 * settings over the CLI to render things differently.  The primary usecase for
 * this is that sometimes I have to debug rendering bugs (like incorrect
 * depth-sorting), and I think it would be helpful to be able to do things like
 * render in wireframe or selectively disable polygons based on display lists,
 * etc.
